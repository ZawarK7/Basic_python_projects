Python Projects Collection
This repository contains a diverse collection of Python projects designed to showcase various skills and applications. From generating passwords to playing text-based games and extracting data from websites, these projects offer a glimpse into different aspects of Python programming.

Project List and Descriptions:
1. Random Password Generator and Strength Checker:
A Python script that generates a random password of specified length, comprising a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, it evaluates the generated password's strength based on multiple criteria such as length and character types.

2. Text-Based Adventure Game:
Embark on an interactive text-based adventure through this Python game. Navigate through a mysterious forest, making crucial decisions that shape your journey. Choose wisely, for each choice determines your fate in this captivating narrative-driven adventure.

3. Web Scraping and Data Extraction:
Explore web scraping capabilities with Python in this project. It scrapes a designated website to extract data such as names and prices from specific HTML elements. The extracted data is then stored in a structured CSV file for further analysis or usage.

4. Text Analysis and Word Frequency Counter:
Analyze text and compute the frequency of words using Python. By reading a given text file, cleaning the data, and counting word occurrences, this project offers insights into basic text processing and analysis.

5. Simple Blackjack Game:
Enjoy a simplified version of the classic card game, blackjack, implemented in Python. Play against the computer (dealer) in this console-based game, making strategic decisions to achieve the highest possible score without exceeding 21.

6. Maze Generation and Solving:
Delve into maze generation and solving algorithms with this Python project. Generate random mazes and employ a search algorithm to find the optimal path from start to finish, showcasing the power of algorithms in solving complex problems.

7. Unit Conversion Tool:
An efficient unit conversion tool implemented in Python. Easily convert between various units such as weight (e.g., kg, lb), length (e.g., meters, inches), and more, providing a practical utility for everyday measurement conversions.
